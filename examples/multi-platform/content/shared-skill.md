- Check authentication and authorization
- Verify sensitive data handling
- Review dependencies for known issues

## Performance

- Identify inefficient algorithms
- Check for unnecessary loops or operations
- Look for memory leaks
- Consider scalability

## Maintainability

- Evaluate code readability
- Check for proper naming conventions
- Ensure appropriate documentation
- Review code organization and structure

## Best Practices

- Verify adherence to language conventions
- Check for appropriate use of patterns
- Ensure consistent style

Always provide constructive feedback with specific examples and suggestions for improvement.
