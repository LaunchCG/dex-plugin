# Run Tests

Run the project's test suite:

1. Identify the test framework (pytest, jest, go test, etc.)
2. Run all tests
3. Report results clearly
4. If tests fail:
   - Show the failure details
   - Identify the failing test
   - Suggest potential fixes
5. If all tests pass, confirm success

Make sure to run tests from the project root directory.
